For a moment, Anjali didn't register it; she was so focused on her task that she hadn't even heard the hard click as the keyboard had been unplugged.\n\nShe hadn't heard the screen go dark, either. What happened? Was it a virus? An internet-based virus? There was no guarantee it wouldn't beurse, but she'd take a look when she got home.\n\nShe knew enough to look but not enough to trust...\n\nWhat, then, caused the screen to black out? Or the computer to be shut off?\n\nShe was just wondering about that when she noticed the door to her right closing. A bolt was being thrown across the entrance to the room.\n\nBut as she turned her head, a sound filled the silence—a low, rumbling growl.\n\nIt was coming from the kitchen, she realized, and not from the hallway, as had been the case at first. That gave her an idea. She should check for the door to the kitchen being unlocked.\n\nShe grabbed her laptop and headed to the door to the left; when she entered the kitchen, she found it ajar. She opened it and found the kitchen empty, save for a pile of crumpled food from last night sitting on the table. The growl was no more, and she glanced around, wondering if it was another trick of her imagination. She hadn't heard it come from anywhere but the kitchen.\n\nBut she wasn't quite as certain it was one—and was still worried about the door to the hallway, given her sudden bolt of intuition. She tried it anyway, opening the door and stepping out into the hallway.\n\nShe was relieved that the door felt solid, and that the growl, whatever it had been, had died away. Her pulse quickened as she glanced to her right, wondering if the door to the bedroom was locked or unlocked. When she saw that it was, she walked to the door, stepped inside, and closed it quickly. Her pulse beat more strongly as she listened again.\n\nAgain, the growl filled the darkness. This time, she was certain of its origin. She knew exactly where it came from.\n\nIt was from the stairs leading up.\n\nA growl grew all too familiar. Anjali felt a shiver of fear run the length of her body as she realized what that noise was....\n\nIt was her parents' screams.\n\n# Chapter 2\n\nShe stood frozen in place, her mind racing, her eyes fluttering back and forth erratically as she tried to figure out what the growl meant. She listened but there was only silence now, as if the whole world had gone still.\n\n_They were in there. They were in the house. And I was just imagining it._\n\nWhy hadn't she checked for the room to be locked? Why hadn't she gone to the kitchen? She should have, but she hadn't. Her own imagination was taking over. Was she even imagining the growl?\n\nHer gaze was drawn to the doorway to the bedroom. Was it unlocked? Or had she just assumed it was? She had nothing to compare it to, except for some imagined noise she'd made earlier. Had it been so awful that it had caused her to think something out of the ordinary had happened?\n\nAnd if so, what exactly had happened?\n\nAs she stood frozen, listening, her heartbeat, at least, was steady. She glanced to the right and her stomach fell. The door, which had been open, was now closed tight.\n\nThe smell of her mother's cooking drifted up the stairs. It was making her nauseous, and the familiar sound of her stepfather's angry curse filled her head. She lightning walked to the door, opened it and stepped inside.\n\n_What was it?_\n\nShe stepped further into the darkness of the hallway, her gaze sweeping left and right, looking for the object that had alerted her to the growl, or for any kind of disturbance.\n\nBut there was nothing.\n\nWas there?\n\nThe growl wasn't an out-of-the-blue warning, or an unanticipated visitor. It had been her father, and she had been in the house alone, unable to make herself leave. What was it?\n\nWhat was it?\n\n\"Is the door locked?\"\n\nAnjali jumped, her eyes flying to the bedroom.\n\n_The door to her room was open._\n\n\"I thought I heard—\"\n\nShe realized she'd been saying _thought_, not _heard._ But her mother's voice was there, and it broke through the rising panic, making her feel a little better.\n\n\"I heard,\" Anjali said. \"I mean... yeah. It was my dad. He was coming up to the house, and I didn't know it was him.\"\n\n\"But... _what_ kind of noise?\"\n\nShe heard the panic in her mother's voice and understood she didn't want to know.\n\n\"It was just a growl. He said something, but I didn't listen, I was... I thought he was coming up here for something, like to fix the pipes. Anyway, I closed the door. When he was just above me, I opened it and—\"\n\n_The growl stopped._\n\nWhat?\n\n\"Did he say anything else?\"\n\nAnjali shook her head hard.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"He's gone.\"\n\n\"Gone? What do you mean?\"\n\nThe sound of her mother's voice was starting to make her nauseous again.\n\nShe closed her eyes and tried to focus on something else.\n\n_What did she mean?_\n\n\"I got up and told ​Him I'd be out in a minute,\" she blurted out.\n\nHer mother's worried question was met with a sigh.\n\n\"Him? Who's Him?\"\n\nShe shook her head again, and this time there was an edge of panic in her voice. \"Dad. The man.\"\n\n\"Not anymore.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"He's in India.\"\n\n\"In India? When was this?\"\n\n\"When was what?\"\n\n\"When did he leave? When did he go?\"\n\n\"I'd guess it was before you got to school today.\"\n\n_I can't remember the last time I had a full night's sleep. I can't remember the last time I got to go to school with him. Why was he suddenly gone when I was just waking up and preparing to sleep some more?_\n","output_type":"stream"}]}]}
